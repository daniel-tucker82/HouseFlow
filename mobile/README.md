# Cyntch native applications

React Native and Expo Router applications for Android and iOS. This directory is
under active development; it is not a completed or store-released application.
The existing web application remains at the repository root.

Use Node 22 and install this application's dependencies separately with `npm ci`.
Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set the API URL and the matching Clerk
publishable key. Never place a Clerk secret key in the mobile application.
For a local Android emulator, the host API URL is `http://10.0.2.2:3010`.
Production builds require HTTPS. Use a Clerk development instance and an isolated
database for testing.

- `npm run start`: start Metro for a development build.
- `npx expo run:android`: generate, build and launch the Android application.
- `npx expo run:ios`: generate, build and launch on a Mac with Xcode.
- `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck`: verify native source.
- `npx expo-doctor`: verify native dependency and configuration compatibility.
- `npx expo export --platform android` (or `ios`): verify JavaScript bundling.

Clerk's native sign-in components require a development build, not Expo Go.
Generated `android/` and `ios/` directories are ignored. Configure native behavior
through `app.json` and config plugins rather than editing generated projects.

The SQLite outbox is account scoped and stores each completion and its cached
result in one transaction. Device-clock correction occurs only for pending edits;
frozen operation IDs and timestamps make interrupted uploads safe to retry.
The server requires migration `0018_completion_operations.sql` before these APIs
or the updated web completion handler are deployed.

From the repository root, run `node --experimental-sqlite --test tests/mobile-*.test.cjs`.
PostgreSQL tests additionally require `CYNTCH_TEST_DATABASE_URL` pointing to a local
database named `cyntch_mobile_test`; their safety guard rejects other destinations.
They create isolated fixtures and clean up their own data.

The previous Capacitor implementation is recoverable from the Git tag
`archive/capacitor-before-native-20261103`. It is superseded by this application.
